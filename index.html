 <p class="subheader"> <strong>Introduction</strong></p>

 <p class="analysis">In 2025, for just the second time ever, the Division I NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament, aka “March Madness,” saw all four of the #1 seeds reach the final four. Throughout the tournament, many fans claimed it was too predictable, and pointed out that higher ranked teams weren’t losing as frequently as they had in years past. However, the basketball was better, and the analytics proved that. Enter KenPom.</p>
<p class="subheader"><strong>What is KenPom?</strong></p>
<p class="analysis">In 2002, Ken Pomeroy began calculating and publishing efficiency ratings for college basketball teams. Fast forward to today, and Pomeroy runs one of the most reputable and trusted source of basketball analytics. There are plenty of team metrics that KenPom publishes, including strength of schedule ratings and even luck ratings, but there are three metrics that decide/are the database’s actual rankings. 
</p>
<p>
<ol class="metrics">
  <em><li>Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (AdjOE)</li>
  <li>Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (AdjDE)</li>
  <li>Adjusted Efficiency Margin (AdjEM)</em>
  (AdjOE-AdjDE --> THE METRIC THAT DECIDES KENPOM'S RANKINGS)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<strong>How are these rankings calculated?</strong>
</p>
<p class="analysis">According to Brandon Parikh, a sophomore studying sport analytics at Syracuse University, play-by-play data is scraped from a source like the NCAA or ESPN which continues to gather this data throughout the season, but the data itself is cleaned and tidied up by a program called HoopR, one of the many programming packages of the R ecosystem. The actual calculations are very complicated process which Pomeroy describes <a href="https://kenpom.com/blog/ratings-explanation/">here</a>. But simply put, Parikh tells me that Pomeroy adjusts offensive and defensive efficiency ratings to the average opponent. This means that adjusted offensive efficiency is the amount of points a team is expected to score on a nationally average defense in 100 possessions, and conversely, adjusted defensive efficiency is the amount of points a team is expected to concede against a nationally average offense in 100 possessions.</p>

<p class="subheader"><strong>What made 2025 different?</strong></p>
<p class="analysis"><strong>Conference Realignment and Expansion - </strong>While conferences had expanded to include teams in the past, it was rarely done on such a massive scale. After the 2023-24 season, the Pacific Athletic Conference (PAC-12) saw ten of its teams join new conferences, including big names such as Oregon, UCLA and Arizona. Four of the other five “power conferences” took in these former PAC-12 schools as well as other schools. </p>
<p>
  <ul class="metrics">
    <li><strong>Conference Expansion:</strong></li>
  <li>ACC 15 teams (2023-24) → 18 teams (2024-25)</li>
  <li>Big Ten 14 teams (2023-24) → 18 teams (2024-25)</li>
  <li>Big 12 14 teams (2023-24) → 16 teams (2024-25)</li>
  <li>SEC 14 teams (2023-24) → 16 teams (2024-25)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="analysis">
  <strong>The SEC - </strong>All conferences were strengthened by expansion because playing better teams more frequently means the metrics will be forgiving in defeat and rewarding in victory. However, the Southeastern conference (SEC) was historically good.
  <ul class="metrics">
    <li>In the ACC/SEC challenge in early December, SEC teams won 14 of 16 matchups against the ACC.</li>
    <li>Every SEC team was at worst 10-3 in non-conference regular season play, all but one school had at least an 11-2 record, Tennessee, Florida and Oklahoma were all 13-0 against non-SEC regular season opponents.</li>
    <li>An SEC team was the #1 team in every weekly AP Poll from December 9th until March 10th. </li>
    <li>Most impressively, the SEC had 14 of its 16 teams make the tournament which shattered the previous record of 11. The conference had half of the one seeds (Auburn and Florida), half of the two seeds (Alabama and Tennessee), and four other top 6 seeds.</li>
    <li>The SEC had two of the final four teams (Auburn and Florida) and Florida won the national championship.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="subheader"><strong>KenPom results</strong></p>
<p class="analysis">Every year, the tournament has its 68-team bracket revealed on “Selection Sunday” in Mid-March. Teams are selected into four different quadrants (regions), which are usually the East, Midwest, South, and West.</p>

<p class="analysis"><strong>Visualization 2</strong> (above) shows the average adjusted efficiency margin between all teams that at least made the Sweet 16 for each tournament since 2015.

  <p class="analysis"><strong>Visualization 3</strong> (above) shows the average adjusted efficiency margin for the teams that made the final four for each individual tournament. With only the final four teams in focus, the 2025 has far and away the best average AdjEM with a mark around +36.8 which, if it were one team, would be the fourth best AdjEM mark of all time.</p>

<p class="subheader"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="analysis">The 2025 Tournament was special, even if it came without the madness fans were hoping for. After an unprecedented season, specifically by the SEC but also by other power conferences such as the Big Ten and Big 12, the tournament delivered in a major way. While it ended with Florida winning the national championship thanks to a crucial stop on the last possession for Houston, the tournament field as a whole was the strongest we've ever seen, and KenPom proves that.</p>
